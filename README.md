# Retro64 Minecraft Mod repository
This is the Minecraft side of the Retro64 mod - It also requires a native library, and an executable for audio support.
Be aware that the code is currently messy, and needs a lot of polishing.

# Status
Mario's complete moveset including the BLJ is implemented.
Mario can attack enemies, swim, travel between dimensions, take damage and heal with XP or water and more, he also has a first person mode making some of these easier.
Currently, the only implemented cap is the Wing Cap, which can be accessed by equiping an elytra.

# Compilation instructions for Windows
!! First ensure you have installed a JDK above v17, you can find a good one [here](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot).

To compile Retro64 on Windows, open Powershell/CMD and run `./gradlew.bat build`
It will begin compiling the mod and if it successfully compiles, you can find the output at build/reobfJar/output.jar

# Compilation instructions for Linux
You should be able to follow the same steps for compiling on windows except instead of running `./gradew.bat build`, instead run `./gradlew build`
